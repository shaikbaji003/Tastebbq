By virtue hereof, the Agent hereby accepts such appointment.</li><br></br>

substantially in the form set out under Annexure I hereof (“Investment Request”) agreed between the Parties.</li> <br></br>
<li> The Account will be based on different tiers preset by the Agent, and each tier will have a different profit rate and a corresponding minimum deposit

<li>A tier applicable for the Principal is decided on the discretion of the Agent, and can be discontinued by the Agent unilaterally, unless otherwise pre-agreed by

entering into the sale contracts pertaining to the same, against cash or credit, with any third party (“Contracts”). The Agent shall have all the authorities from
the Principal to claim its rights under the Contracts, executed in the Agent’s name, and to fulfill its obligations within such Contracts.</li><br></br>
<li>assume all losses and liabilities incurred by the Principal resulting from the Agent’s gross negligence and/or willful misconduct.</li> <br></br>

cash or on credit in conformity with the principles of Shari’ah.</li> <br></br>
<li>invest the Funds, on a “best effort” basis, in Contracts which have the potential to meet the Indicative Profit Rate. If such Contracts are not readily available in
the market, the Agent shall obtain the consent of the Principal prior to entering into such other Contracts which may have lower return rates. For this purpose,
the Principal will be requested by the Agent, through email or recorded telephone line, to provide its consent to the Agent to enter into such Contracts with
expected lower return rates. The Principal will, if it agrees to such request, provide its consent to the Agent by sending an email confirmation within 2 working
days from the time the Agent made the request (“Consent Period”). The Principal shall be deemed to have given its consent after the lapse of the Consent
Period and the Agent can proceed to act without the need of any further notice to the Principal.</li> <br></br>
<li>if the return on the existing Contracts is expected to be less than the Indicative Profit Rate, renegotiate the Indicative Profit Rate with the Principal based on
prevailing market conditions as determined by the Agent. During renegotiation, the Agent shall be bound to keep the Funds invested in accordance with the
existing Relevant Wakalah.</li>

charged by the Agent shall be in accordance with the guidelines of the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates.<br></br>
In the event that any amount payable (or part thereof) under this Agreement is not paid on its due date (the balance thereof being an<b> &quot;Unpaid Sum&quot;</b>), the Late
Payment Rate shall be applied to the Unpaid Sum (based on a demand from the Agent) and the resulting amount shall accrue daily and shall be paid by the<br></br>

expenses incurred as a result of such late payment from the Late Payment Amount and shall transfer the balance of the Late Payment Amount to an<br></br>
Islamic charity of its choice as decided by its ISSC.<br></br><br></br>
All payments due to the Agent under this Agreement shall be made so that each such payment is received by the Agent in cleared funds on or before 10:00 a.m. on
the day on which such payment is due to be paid.<br></br><br></br>

under this Agreement in the following order of precedence: (i) fees and commissions; (ii) profit; (iii) principal; (iv) actual costs and expenses related to the
Late Payment Amounts; and (v) the Late Payment Amount.<br></br><br></br>

the extent it has considered this necessary, taken independent advice from advisors specializing in Shari&#39;ah, it is satisfied that the provisions of each
Product Document do not contravene Shari&#39;ah. Therefore, Principal shall not contest on the Shari’ah noncompliance and shall not prejudice any
obligations under this Agreement.<br></br><br></br>
The Principal shall not engage in any business or activity that is not compliant with Shari’ah.
</p>
</div><br></br>
<div className='annexure-para-title'>
        <p><b>4. INDEMNIFICATION</b></p><br></br>
</div>
<div className='para'>
    <p>The Principal shall defend, indemnify and hold the Agent free and harmless on demand from and against any deficiency in the amounts received by the Agent
including without limitation any shortfall arising from payment in a different currency.<br></br><br></br>
The Principal shall defend, indemnify and hold the Agent free and harmless on demand against any and all claims, actions, liabilities, losses, costs and expenses
(including, without limitation, court costs and attorney charges) which the Agent may suffer or incur arising from or relating to or in connection with (a)
the entry by the Agent into this Agreement or any other agreement or contract relating thereto, or (b) the breach by the Principal of this Agreement or
any other agreement or contract relating thereto.<br></br><br></br>
The indemnification obligations of the Principal under this Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement (including this Agreement) and shall constitute
separate and independent obligations of the Principal. The Principal’s obligations in Clause 4.1 and Clause 4.2 to indemnify the Agent shall not apply to the
extent arising due to the fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct of the Agent as finally and judicially proven.<br></br><br></br>
For the avoidance of doubt, the Principal’s obligations under this Agreement to indemnify the Agent shall not apply to the extent arising due to the fraud, gross

</div><br></br>
<div className='annexure-para-title'>
        <p><b>5. MISCELLANEOUS</b></p><br></br>
</div>
<div className='para'>
<p>Neither Party may amend this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party. Any amendments shall be subject to Shari’ah Standards.<br></br><br></br>
If any transaction under this Agreement involves the conversion of one currency into another, unless otherwise agreed, the Agent shall make such conversions at its
then prevailing rate of exchange for purchasing or selling the relevant currency, as the case may be, on the date of the exchange.<br></br><br></br>
As per the ongoing regulatory requirements of the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates, the Agent is obliged to comply with Shari’ah Standards. The Principal
irrevocably agrees to forego any rights and remedies that are not compliant with the Shari’ah Standards, and would have been available had the Shari’ah
Standards not been complied with.<br></br><br></br>
The Parties recognize and agree that the principle of the payment of interest is prohibited under Shari’ah and accordingly, to the extent that any legal system would
(but for the provisions of this Clause) impose (whether by contract or by statute) any obligation to pay interest, the Parties hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally expressly waive and reject any entitlement to recover interest from each other.</p>
